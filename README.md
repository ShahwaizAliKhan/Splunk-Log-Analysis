<h2>ðŸ§  DNS Log Analysis using Splunk</h2>

<p>This project focuses on analyzing DNS logs using Splunk to detect anomalies, failed lookups, and suspicious network behavior. Below are the key steps performed during the analysis process.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Field Extraction</h3>
<p>Extracted important fields such as timestamp, source IP, destination IP, protocol, query, and response code using Splunkâ€™s field extraction feature.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Basic Log Exploration</h3>
<p>Performed basic searches to explore DNS traffic patterns, top queried domains, and response statistics.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Security-Focused Analysis</h3>
<p>Conducted in-depth searches to detect anomalies such as failed lookups (NXDOMAIN), suspicious record types, and potential domain generation algorithm (DGA) activity.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Visualization Dashboards</h3>
<p>Created Splunk dashboards to visualize DNS activity, including top queried domains, source IPs, and response code distribution.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Threat Detection Alerts</h3>
<p>Configured Splunk alerts to automatically detect abnormal DNS behavior, such as repeated NXDOMAIN responses or unusual record types.</p>
